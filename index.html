    <h3>February 14, 2016</h3>
    <p>A year ago from today, I was pleased to have found myself a Valentine. Little did I know that that was just the first of many Valentine's days to come. From here on, February 14th will always be a special day to me because I get to celebrate my love for you, M@. But even better, I want to treat every day like Valentine's Day because that's how everyday feels with you. </br></br>
First, I want to flash back to last Valentine's day.</p>

      <h3>Pink Tullips (My favorite)</h3>
      <p>You surprised me with pink tullips, and that was all I could've asked for. My first set of flowers on Valentine's Day.</p>

      <h3>Pickles (Also my favorite)</h3>
      <p>But you didn't just stop at the flowers. You got me my favorite vegetable (whether or not pickles count as someone's favorite vegetable is still up for debate.</p>

      <h3>Onion Goggles</h3>
      <p>And let's not forget my very own pair of pink onion goggles. Believe it or not they've come in handy this last year. Pretty soon they'll be sitting next to your black pair in our very own kitchen drawer.</p>

    <h3 class="list">What I've learned about you since last Valentine's Day</h3>
    <p>I knew there was something special about you since when I first met you, but the list just keeps growing and growing. If I was to write out an entire list, I would be writing forever. But here are some of my favorite reasons as to why you're so special to me (in no particular order).</p>
    <div class="list">
      <ul>
        <li>You have a cute butt.</li>
        <li>You have the happiest smile.</li>
        <li>You always hold my hand or you hold me.</li>
        <li>You are kind to elderly people.</li>
        <li>You like/grow baby tomatoes.</li>
        <li>You remind me to brush my teeth.</li>
        <li>You strive everyday to be better and to make us better.</li>
        <li>You tell me you love me and how amazing you think I am every single day.</li>
